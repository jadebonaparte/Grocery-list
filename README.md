# Grocery-list
Grocery list that can be adjusted. The user chooses from 8 options, whatever option they choose either adds to the grocery list, allows them to view the list, marks an item in the list as completed, removes an item from the list, allows the user to exit the program, removes all items from the list, sorts the list alphabetically, or counts the number of items on the list. The user gets to choose from all these options until they exit the program. 

I worked with Anna on this project.
